# Developer Tech Test 

My solution to the test as described [here](https://gist.github.com/mattmcgrattan/42172e829e50ce037ae62927cb95ecfe).

The code will analyse the text on the URL given in the payload and extract and count named entities. For each person, it will count the occurrences and compute which locations are mentioned within a span of 100 words to both sides of the name. 

## Data

The data was mostly tested with texts on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). 

For an easier example, check the [sample text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/athrado/api_task/main/sample_text.txt"), travel adventures generated by ChatGPT. The text was manually modified to include many filler sequences in order to easily count locations within a 100 word span. 

## How to run



## How to test

You can test the API, for example with a sample text generated with ChatGPT:

```curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"URL": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/athrado/api_task/main/sample_text.txt", "author": "ChatGPT", "title": "Travel Stories"}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/get_text/```

Which character travelled the most? 

You can test the code with: `pytest app/test_main.py`
